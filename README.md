Web enabled tandem code
As of 4/15/15 This project is two pronged.

Prong 1
Tandem0.2.py contains the main logic to perform analytics on text and images. It
can be run from the command line. It prompts you for the location of your input files.
Enter the name of the folder, making sure to include a trailing forward slash

e.g. /Users/user/data/inputfolder/

Output is written to /Users/user/data/tandemout/



Prong 2
In the early steps of web enabling the engine we built in Prong 1, a series of html files
are built and can be navigated by the user. No actual functionality currently exists.
